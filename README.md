# SSXL Monolith

> _“SSXL is not a plugin. It’s a weapon.”_

**SSXL** is a low-level game kernel written in Rust.  
It is not a framework. It is not a plugin.  
It is an engine — but not the kind that draws pixels.

SSXL is designed to scale, persist, and evolve.  
It handles the logic most engines defer, abstract, or ignore.

## ⚙️ What Is SSXL?

SSXL is a modular kernel for simulation and state orchestration.  
It is engine-agnostic, runtime-agnostic, and renderer-independent.

It does not manage your UI.  
It does not dictate your input system.  
It does not care what frontend you use.

It handles:

- Persistent world state  
- Procedural generation  
- Real-time synchronization  
- Modular logic routing  
- Cross-platform deployment  

SSXL is the part of the stack that survives refactors, rewrites, and reboots.

## 🧱 Current Status

- Core kernel in active development  
- No bindings, no wrappers, no GUI  
- Procedural systems and async sync layers underway  
- FFI bridges planned, but optional  
- Source is public, but intentionally buried

## 🧠 Design Principles

> _“The grid is not given. It is written.”_

SSXL is built on the principle that complexity is not a flaw — it’s a feature.  
We do not abstract away systems. We expose them.  
We do not simplify logic. We modularize it.

Every subsystem is a signal.  
Every signal is a choice.  
Every choice is explicit.

This is not a toolkit. It is infrastructure.

## 📜 License

SSXL is currently under a restrictive license during initial development.  
No commercial use. No derivatives. No closed forks.  
This is not a release. It is a forge.

## 🕯️ Closing Note

If you’re reading this, you’re early.  
If you’re building with this, you’re serious.  
If you’re forking this, you understand what it is.
