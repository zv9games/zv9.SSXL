SSXL MONOLITH — THESIS & ROADMAP
================================================================================

THESIS:
SSXL is a low-level simulation kernel engineered to breach the abstraction barrier in game architecture.
It is not a plugin, framework, or renderer. It is the computational substrate beneath emergent systems —
designed to scale, persist, and evolve across runtime boundaries.

CONCEPT SUMMARY:
SSXL represents a quantum-aligned approach to simulation logic: modular, deterministic, and signal-driven.
Where traditional engines obscure complexity behind monolithic design, SSXL exposes it — enabling precise
orchestration of persistent worlds, procedural systems, and real-time synchronization across distributed
environments. It is the part of the stack that survives refactors, reboots, and revolutions — the kernel
beneath the myth.
