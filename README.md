# SSXL Monolith

> _“SSXL is not a plugin. It’s a weapon.”_

**SSXL** is a low-level game kernel written in Rust.  
It is not a framework. It is not an engine.  
It is a core — designed to scale, persist, and evolve.

SSXL is the part of the stack that most people skip.  
It handles the logic they assume someone else already solved.

## ⚙️ What Is SSXL?

SSXL is a modular kernel for game simulation.  
It is engine-agnostic, runtime-agnostic, and designed for long-term scale.

It does not care what renderer you use.  
It does not care what input system you prefer.  
It does not care about your UI.

It handles:

- World state persistence  
- Procedural generation  
- Real-time sync layers  
- Modular logic routing  
- Cross-platform deployment  

It is the part of the engine that survives when everything else is replaced.

## 🧱 Current Status

- Core kernel in active development  
- No bindings, no wrappers, no GUI  
- Procedural systems and async sync layers underway  
- FFI bridges planned, but not required  
- Source is public, but buried — intentionally

## 🌀 Philosophy

> _“The grid is not given. It is written.”_

SSXL is built on the assumption that complexity is not the enemy — abstraction is.  
We do not hide systems. We expose them.  
We do not simplify logic. We modularize it.

Every subsystem is a signal.  
Every signal is a choice.  
Every choice is explicit.

## 📜 License

SSXL is under a restrictive license during initial development.  
No commercial use. No derivatives. No closed forks.  
This is not a release. It is a forge.

## 🕯️ Final Note

If you’re reading this, you’re early.  
If you’re building with this, you’re brave.  
If you’re forking this, you know what you’re doing.
